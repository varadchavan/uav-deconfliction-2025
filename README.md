# UAV Strategic Deconfliction System

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based UAV strategic deconfliction system for the FlytBase Robotics Assignment 2025. The system verifies if a drone's waypoint mission is safe by checking for spatial and temporal conflicts with other drones' flight paths. It includes 2D/3D visualizations, a 4D animation (extra credit), automated tests, and a reflection document.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) for compiling `reflection.tex`
- (Optional) OBS Studio for recording the demo video
